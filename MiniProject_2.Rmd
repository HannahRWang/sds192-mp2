#This chunk creates a new dataset called "contributions_alt" that filters for "24E" (independent expenditure advocating election of candidate) and "G2012" (2012 General Election). It also only includes variables that are relevant to further analyses. 
```

```{r}

  filter(cand_election_yr == "2012", cand_office == "P")

#This chunk creates a new dataset called "candidates_alt" that filters for "2012" (2012 election round) and "P" (Presidential election race). This way, both "contributions_alt" and "candidates_alt" only include data from the General Election of 2012.  
```

```{r}
joined_table <- contributions_alt %>%
  full_join(candidates_alt, by = "cand_id") %>%
  filter(entity_type == "IND", state == "CA") %>%
  group_by(state, cand_name) %>%
  summarize(avg_donation = mean(transaction_amt))%>%
  na.omit

#This chunk joins the two datasets just created. It filters for only donations which have an entity classified as "IND" representing individuals from "CA", California. The variable transaction_amt is summarized to calculate the average donation for each candidate by state. The new dataset that results from this join is called "joined_table" and returns two observations of three variables. We have successfully calculated how much money individuals in California donated on average to Barack Obama and Mitt Romney's 2012 Presidential Campaigns.

#This chunk creates a function that joins candidates_alt and contributions_alt but can additionally filter for any donation entity type we ask it to. This way, we can study more entity types.
